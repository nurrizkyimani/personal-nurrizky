  - I am a computer science graduate from Universitas Gadjah Mada, with a deep passion for software engineering and research in computational linguistics, complemented by over three years of experience in developing production-level products. During my studies, I gained experience in research in Natural Language Processing and got hands-on with a wide range of programming work, from frontend and backend development to cloud computing
    
  - My expertise extends beyond technical skills; I see work through the lens of business acumen gained from roles such as Project Consultant for YLI National Wave 14 Projects under McKinsey & Company, and being selected for the Gojek Product Development Camp and the Stanford Longevity Design Challenge 2021. Actively involved in the tech community, I was selected as a University Innovation Fellow at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford and earned an invitation to the 2022 Silicon Valley Meetup from impact I created
    
  - Personally, I believe we live in a great modern world of abundance, driven by techno-capital progress. I see obsession as motivation and am curious about three things in life (Algorithm/System, Techno-Capital/Progress, and Narrative/Power). I view each of my works and life as an adventure encompassing all these three aspects.
